# DTS2AC3

This GUI application is intended to simplify the process of converting DTS audio tracks within MKV (Matroska) files into AC3 audio tracks. This conversion process is accomplished by leveraging the FFmpeg library, which is a popular and powerful software framework for handling multimedia data.

# User Interface
